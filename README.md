# winners-losers

[Repast4Py](https://repast.github.io/repast4py.site/index.html) initial model
following a quite simple idea for the initial example:

something close to the *Chakraborti model* in "Winners, Losers" example in [Is Inequality Inevitable? (Sc.Am.)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-inequality-inevitable/). In a closer way, ยง 2.1 in [Chakraborti, A. (2002). Distributions of money in model markets of economy. International Journal of Modern Physics C, 13(10), 1315-1321](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0205221.pdf).

The implementation uses Repast4Py ghosts.
